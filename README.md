# Msc-Dissertation
This repository contains the codes written in google Collaboratory as part of the fulfillment for the award of MSc Data Science from the University of Salford.
The first script named "TracyCreditRisk(RFECV).ipynb" contains codes used to execute experiment one of my dissertation. This script selects important features using the RFECV model then completes the execution of the algorithms using the class variable of the dataset
The second file named "TracyCreditRisk(f_classif).ipynb" runs the algorithms using the selected features from the dataset using f_classif forming experiment 2
